This guide will walk you through the process of forking a repository and uploading files into it. Forking a repository allows you to create a copy of someone else's project under your GitHub account, which you can modify without affecting the original project. Uploading files into a repository enables you to contribute your changes or additions to the project.

### Forking the repositary
<strong>1. Navigate to the Repository:</strong> Visit the GitHub page of the repository you want to fork. You can usually find it by searching for the repository name.<br>
<strong>2. Fork the Repository:</strong> Click on the "Fork" button located at the top-right corner of the repository page. This action will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
