# CY-C_Programming


This guide will walk you through the process of forking a repository and uploading files into it. Forking a repository allows you to create a copy of someone else's project under your GitHub account, which you can modify without affecting the original project. Uploading files into a repository enables you to contribute your changes or additions to the project.<br>

### Forking the repositary<br>
<strong>1. Navigate to the Repository:</strong> Visit the GitHub page of the repository you want to fork. You can usually find it by searching for the repository name.<br>
<strong>2. Fork the Repository:</strong> Click on the "Fork" button located at the top-right corner of the repository page. This action will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.<br>

<strong>4. Drag and Drop Files:</strong> Drag and drop the files you want to upload from your computer's file explorer into the designated area in the browser window. Alternatively, you can click on the area to browse your computer and select files manually.<br>

<strong>5. Commit Changes:</strong> After adding the files, you need to commit them to the repository. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to find the commit section. Here, you can provide a brief description of the changes you're making. It's good practice to provide a meaningful commit message that describes the purpose of the upload.<br>

<strong>6. Commit Changes:</strong> Click on the "Commit changes" button to finalize the upload. Your files will be added to the repository, and you'll be redirected to the repository's main page.<br><br><br>

Congratulations! You have successfully uploaded files into the repository directly through the GitHub web interface. You can continue to add more files or make further changes using the same process.
